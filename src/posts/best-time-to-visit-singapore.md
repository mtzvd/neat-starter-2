title: Best time to visit Singapore
description: Singapore is an exotic country. Singapore has ten official
  religions and four official languages, colorful festivals almost weekly, huge
  business centers, and authentic stores. One of the world's best airport,
  futuristic skyscrapers and a feng shui-approved Ferris wheel, plenty of
  entertainment for everyone, including families with children, groups of
  friends and business travelers, and even Michelin-starred street food await
  visitors to Singapore. The name "Lion City" is a literal translation from
  Sanskrit, and the list of unofficial names is rather long, from "Disneyland
  for Adults" and "Garden City" to "City of Prohibition". The latter, by the
  way, directly indicates an important feature of Singapore, which causes a
  lively interest among visitors and has allowed the state to become one of the
  most prosperous in the world in just half a century.

Located on 63 islands, Singapore is known not only as a major financial and business center in Southeast Asia but also as a real garden city — there are [300 parks](http://getexperience.com/experiences/326?utm_source=blog_gexp&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=valentina&utm_content=best_time_to_visit_singapore) and four national reserves in Singapore. Beach traveling here is also great, but it is not in the first place. The most famous beach club hotels are located on Sentosa Island, and fans of seclusion and beautiful views can visit small nearby islands. They have wild beaches, rare tropical animals, and even a kind of travel through time: there you can see what Singapore [looked like as a fishing village](http://getexperience.com/experiences/432?utm_source=blog_gexp&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=valentina&utm_content=best_time_to_visit_singapore).

## Weather in Singapore

Singapore's weather is stable all year round, so you can visit the country any time you want. The country is located on the equator, temperature fluctuations are minimal. The average temperature ranges from +30 to +32 (the difference between winter and summer is less than 2 degrees, so there are no high or low seasons). The average humidity is 80%. The climate in Singapore is a tropical monsoon, and there is rain all year round, but it is usually short and not widespread. The exception is from November to February when it rains for days at a time making this period the worst to visit.

> The best time to visit [Singapore](http://getexperience.com/experiences/421?utm_source=blog_gexp&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=valentina&utm_content=best_time_to_visit_singapore) is from May to October.

### Wintertime in Singapore

The weather in Singapore in wintertime is warm and rainy. It may rain for days or stop for a few hours. During the winter time, the average temperature in Singapore is around +26. Because of the high temperatures and heavy rainfall, humidity is high during this time of year, which makes it more difficult for people with poor health. Rarely, however, temperatures can drop as low as +20.

### Springtime in Singapore

The weather in Singapore during spring is warm with less rainfall. The average temperature in the springtime is about +27.

### Summertime in Singapore

The weather in [Singapore](http://getexperience.com/experiences?realm=person&googlePlaceId=ChIJdZOLiiMR2jERxPWrUs9peIg&utm_source=blog_gexp&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=valentina&utm_content=best_time_to_visit_singapore) generally becomes drier during the summertime and there is less rain. The general humidity level decreases as well, and temperatures rise slightly to 28. Summer is the best time to visit Singapore.

### Autumn in Singapore

The weather in Singapore during autumn tends to become wetter, especially in mid-to-late autumn when it can rain for days. The humidity also begins to rise in mid-autumn, and many visitors experience discomfort as a result. The average temperature in Singapore in the fall is about +26. It’s the best time for traveling to Singapore.

## Humidity in Singapore

Humidity varies from 60% to 100%. It is a critical factor to consider when planning a trip because high humidity, combined with the tropical heat, can turn a carefree visit into a real challenge. The amount of humidity depends on the wind direction. The northeast monsoon blows between November and February, when Singapore experiences light monsoon rains almost every day and fogs in March. In April, the frequency of rainfall decreases, but it's replaced by a more noticeable heat wave: the sun heats the air to +38.

## Rain in Singapore

The average monthly rainfall in [Singapore](http://getexperience.com/experiences?realm=person&googlePlaceId=ChIJdZOLiiMR2jERxPWrUs9peIg&utm_source=blog_gexp&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=valentina&utm_content=best_time_to_visit_singapore) is above 140 millimeters, peaking in the months of November and March. The rain is warm, though heavy. Often there are thunderstorms, but these ones pass rather quickly, leaving behind the divine smell of renewed tropical greenery. The rain can start suddenly, so an umbrella is better to have with you all the time you travel to Singapore. The best way to escape bad weather and a tropical downpour and still have the best time is to visit the mall. Singapore has entire cities with excellent stores, restaurants, spas, and cinemas, and almost every mall is accessible directly from the subway.

## Festivals & Events in Singapore

Despite the tiny size of Singapore, there are plenty of festivals and celebrations that visitors may enjoy. The most colorful and vibrant national festivals are the Chinese New Year celebrations, the Hindu Pongal and Thaipusam festivals in February, the Hougang Spring Festival in late February, and God-Children's Birthday on May 1st. Also of interest are the Dragon Boat Festival in May and June, the festival of classical Indian dance and music — Chettiar Temple Festival — and the Timiti Fire Purification Ceremony in October. Navaratri ("Nine Lights” in Tamil), is held in October and lasts nine days, according to the number of luminaries. During the celebration, people of Singapore are supposed to bring songs and dances in honor of the Indian goddesses Durga and Lakshmi Saraswati to Singapore. In November, Deepavali, the country's most important Hindu holiday, marks the victory of Light over Darkness.

In January and February, [Singapore](http://getexperience.com/experiences?realm=person&googlePlaceId=ChIJdZOLiiMR2jERxPWrUs9peIg&utm_source=blog_gexp&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=valentina&utm_content=best_time_to_visit_singapore) locals celebrate the Spring Festival — Chunjie. From December to March, the Muslim holidays of Hari Raya Haji (Feast of Sacrifice) are held. Good Friday and Easter are celebrated from April to May. Buddha's Birthday (or Vesak) is celebrated here on May 6. The social events include Singapore Art Week in January, the famous Singapore Food Festival in summer, and the Cocktail Festival in October.

## Beaches in Singapore

Until a few years ago, beach holidays in Singapore were not very popular among the visitors. Travelers were wary of the proximity to the port, but the use of innovative cleaning systems and infrastructure development have changed the situation radically. For now there are many beaches, all of which are free to enter, clean, and equipped with toilets, cabins for changing clothes, showers, and even coded lockers.

> The best main island beaches are concentrated on the east coast of Singapore.

East Coast Park, one of Singapore's most popular urban vacation spots, offers plenty of activities for travelers, including sports and gastronomy, and is known for its manicured, clear seas and gentle sandy bottoms. Changi Beach Park, one of Singapore's oldest waterfront parks at about 3.3 km long. It still retains the ambience of a kampong fishing village: white sand, coconut palms, barbecue areas, benches, and sheds make it the best place for families to relax, swim, and picnic. Singapore visitors love it!

Singapore's most famous beaches are on Sentosa, where the sea is clear, the scenery is delightful, and almost every beach has its own "specialization". Siloso Beach is popular with lovers of active leisure: there you can learn to surf on an artificial wave, swim in a kayak, ride a bike or rollerblade, and in the evening there is one big party. Tanjong Beach is beloved by families, couples, and groups of travelers. The nighttime atmosphere is very romantic, and you can go sup surfing during the day at the Stand Up Paddling School. Palawan Beach is a quiet beach for families, with plenty of cafes, stores, and a wonderful viewpoint.

## Diving in Singapore

You can't call [Singapore](http://getexperience.com/experiences?realm=person&googlePlaceId=ChIJdZOLiiMR2jERxPWrUs9peIg&utm_source=blog_gexp&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=valentina&utm_content=best_time_to_visit_singapore) a diving mecca, but you can still find places worth diving here. Just visit any of the nearby islands — all within easy reach of bustling Sentosa. Sea eagles and holothuria live off the coast of St. Johns, and the clear water allows you to spot authentic flora and fauna, even in deep water. Along the shores of Pulau Kapas, moray eels, fugu, parrot fish, stingrays, and sea urchins live. Pulau Redang is home to red anemones, seahorses, turtles, and sometimes even sharks. Swarms of brightly colored tropical fish, barracudas, and spotted bass wait for divers off Pulau Tioman Island. Off the coast of Bintan, Indonesia, experienced divers can explore the bilges and decks of six World War II wrecks. There are ferries from Singapore's port, the trip takes 45 minutes, and no Indonesian visa is required.

## The best time for shopping in Singapore

Shopping in Singapore is a special kind of pleasure. Not every country can boast such a great number of shops, from giant malls to local craftsmen's shops. Prices, on the other hand, cannot be called "Asian," as they are more comparable to European and American prices. Stores of luxury brands are concentrated on Orchard Road, where the largest shopping centers and boutiques of the world's major brands are located. ION Orchard is a mall for fans of Prada, Dior, D&G, Cartier, and Hugo Boss. The Paragon is the place for Gucci, Bvlgari, Burberry, Jimmy Choo, Armani Exchange, Calvin Klein Jeans, and DKNY fans. For local designers, go to Tangs Plaza, Robinsons or the Design Orchard Center, where over 60 local brands are represented.

> The best time to shop is during Singapore's only major sale, the Grand Sale, which begins at the end of May and runs through July and August. Prices in stores drop by 50-70%.

The best markets in the city are Geylang Serai and Tiong Baru, with fresh produce and [exotic delicacies like shark meat](http://getexperience.com/experiences/433?utm_source=blog_gexp&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=valentina&utm_content=best_time_to_visit_singapore). And for lovers of handmade, authentic, and unusual accessories, there are regular art bazaars with exclusive items and vintage finds. For instance, Kampong Gelam is a mix of history, fashion, and stylish boutiques. Hit the hipster hangout Haji Lane and check out the authentic shops that have been around for decades.

> Singapore's stores are open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and until 10 p.m. on weekends; only the smaller ones are closed for lunch.

## Entertainment in Singapore

In Singapore, there are many attractions that can interest fans of classical "sightseeing" and fans of exotic entertainment. Start with the Botanical Gardens, founded over 150 years ago. The area is 101 hectares of lushly blooming and smelling flora from around the world: tropical and equatorial endemics, orchids, palms, and ferns. From flora to fauna, visit the Singapore Zoo. It is a home to more than 2,500 animals, including many endangered species. After excursions, take a ride on the rides and attractions. The 165m Singapore Flyer Ferris Wheel takes your breath away with its beauty and heights, the Skyline and Skyride karting centers on Sentosa offer speed, the MegaZip ropes park offers thrills,and the amazing world of Universal Studios offers everything.

After you've seen the creations of nature, it's time to appreciate the man-made masterpieces. Singapore is not only skyscrapers, huge artificial trees and a sculpture of the mythical creature Merlion. One of the main symbols of the Lion City is located at a height of 191 m on the roof of a fantastic building — the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The Infinity Pool is a pool with a catchy name: it really seems endless, because the steel construction stretches almost 150 m in length and its edges seem to drop off at the level of the 60th floor. In reality, this illusion is created by the fact that the water traps are installed slightly lower than the sides of the pool.

In the nearby Merlion Park, a statue of the mythical beast greets visitors to the city. An architectural throwback to a bygone era is the snow-white Raffles Hotel, a paragon of elegance and respectability. One of the main religious landmarks is the Sri Mariamman Temple, with its gorgeous facade studded with statues of Hindu deities. Fort Siloso, the only surviving gun battery, is a reminder of World War II.

## Important information for Singapore travelers

The relaxed traveler in Singapore faces rules and prohibitions at every turn: be vigilant and read the labels on all prohibiting signs. Gambling and chewing gum are forbidden in the country. Travelers will not be punished for chewing gum, but if they spit it on the sidewalk past the trash can, the fine will be high. Trash thrown in the street carries a penalty of 300-1000 SGD, and repeat offenses may result in jail time. Fines of SGD 300-1000 can be imposed for littering in the street. Smoking is prohibited in enclosed public places, buses, elevators, cinemas, theaters, government offices, restaurants, and stores. The fine is the same: 500-1000 SGD. For crossing the road in the wrong place, you pay 500 SGD. The same amount will be charged for eating on public transport or driving a car without a seat belt.

The crime rate in the country is very low: you can leave your belongings, documents, and even money wherever you want; they won't be stolen. When visiting temples and mosques, the hands and feet must be covered with clothes. When entering Indian temples and mosques, it is recommended to take off shoes. The same should be done when entering houses and apartments of residents. It is forbidden to take pictures or film images of Buddha in Buddhist temples. It is better to wear light cotton clothing to bear the heat. And don't forget about the air conditioning systems! Almost all the stores and office buildings are stuffed with a conditioning system here: a sweater with long sleeves won't be needless.
